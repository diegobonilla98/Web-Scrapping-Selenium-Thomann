# Web-Scrapping-Selenium-Thomann
A small script to fetch guitar images, metadata, and the audio samples for a possible deep learning model for later.



## Warning!
This is some scripts I've made for tests and/or meaningless projects. They are not made to be easy to understand, optimized nor working. They surely have some interesting stuff so for any questions please talk to me in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-bonilla-salvador/).
